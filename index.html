They operate on predictable, consumption-based models and need software that scales with them, not against them. Recast fits perfectly into this model by being easy to deploy, multitenant, and designed for repeatable use across clients.\n\nRather than making margin on licenses, MSPs make money on the services they deliver around the software — configuration, automation, monitoring, and continuous management. Recast helps them improve their margins by reducing manual effort, increasing client coverage, and adding high-value capabilities they can bundle into existing service offerings.\n\nFor many MSPs, Recast also opens the door to application management as a service, expanding beyond traditional infrastructure or security management into new, higher-value revenue streams.\n\nMSP partners are a key part of Recast’s ecosystem — they scale our reach, drive recurring adoption, and deliver measurable customer outcomes every month.",

This creates a tightly coupled, scalable go-to-market motion where Recast’s value is distributed through a trusted, established platform — accelerating adoption and expanding market penetration.\n\nOEM partnerships are highly strategic and collaborative, often involving joint engineering, product road mapping, and go-to-market alignment at both the technical and executive level.\n\nTogether, OEM partners and Recast bring enterprise-grade solutions to market faster, reduce deployment complexity for customers, and create durable, high-value revenue streams for both organizations.",

They handle localized sales, billing, and first-line support, ensuring smooth customer engagement while helping Recast maintain brand and commercial consistency across markets.\n\nDistributors are responsible for developing regional pipeline, building and enabling sub-partners, and executing go-to-market plans aligned with Recast’s global objectives. They also collaborate with Recast on marketing, events, and regional channel strategy to ensure sustained partner and customer growth.\n\nThis model allows Recast to enter new markets efficiently, ensure local expertise, and scale faster through a trusted regional partner that’s fully invested in our success."
